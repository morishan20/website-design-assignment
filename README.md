# User stories: 
## Returning User (John): 
As a returning user and a father, I want the website to store my information as well as letting me reuse/edit my previous holiday plan so that I can save time when booking a new family holiday.

- Edit or rebook the trip 

- Change dates/activities 

- Check the total cost 

- Confirm the trip or save it for later 

 

## Acceptance Criteria:
